Somehow, the holidays do not\\nseem enough.My parents are treating COVID-19 patients and often discuss their healthcare. \\nAt times, I \\x1fnd their conversations scary and mom calms me down by saying this will end soon.\\nYet, I am hardly convinced with her explanations. In the little time that I get to talk to \\nmy friends, we discuss the current situation due to pandemic and its advantages, especially \\non the environment, as us human beings are in lockdown.\\nA few days ago, when my father and I were sitting in the balcony at night I looked up in the\\nsky and saw a lot more stars than I usually get to see. Even my mom told me that Yamuna\\nriver is getting cleaner amidst the lockdown.\\nI also feel that my friends have their parents at home, spending quality time with them and\\nall having fun times, together. While they have fun, my parents are at the hospital treating\\npatients and, of course, this is something that makes me very proud. Still, it is not the same\\nas having them at home.\\nHowever, the advantage of not having parents at home is that I do not have to do any work\\nuntil they are back. A few weeks ago, I panicked thinking that I would not get to celebrate my\\nbirthday on its due date, just as it was not celebrated the previous three consecutive years on\\nthe birthday day, since my parents were busy treating patients of either typhoid, pneumonia\\nor dengue. A sigh of relief, this year it does not matter that much as long as my family and I\\nare safe.\\nI am also anxious about school; I hope that they do not take away our summer holidays to\\nmake up for the missed school days. I always enjoyed attending Bharatanatyam dance\\nclasses but now, due to the lockdown, we have these classes on Zoom, which I can only\\nimagine, must be hard for the teacher as she tries to make it look e\\nortless. These classes,\\non the other hand, do us some good, as we do not get to copy someone if we need to.\\nOn weekdays the school gives us work, which I sometimes \\x1fnd overwhelming, but it is\\nmore work on their side, so that is impressive. Another thing I like is the kind of e\\nort the\\nteachers are making to teach us by newer methods like making videos of concepts and\\neven dance steps, so hats o\\n to them for that!\\nOn days when we do have homework, my parents when home check it, which is good\\nbecause after the tiring day at work they still spend time with us.\\nOut of the many things I have learned during the lockdown, one main thing is that my parents\\nkeep reminding through their example that we should keep hope and stay positive'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":31}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"XEDG3iX5a7Zn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608807920755,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3701,"user":{"displayName":"fifty five","photoUrl":"","userId":"18267456517574414507"}},"outputId":"0a327a03-9659-4468-ab10-e02f45993649"},"source":["text = ''' The primary reasons for the American revolution were \n","1.
